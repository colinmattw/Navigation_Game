A demo of a potential game I made at the request of my professor who sought to bring a fun and exciting way to teach young children programming concepts.

This project introduced me to several new concepts in programming:
1. My first major project using the RayLib library, and a non STL library in C++ language.
2. My frst relatively large implementation of object oriented design.
3. My first project where graphical interface and user interface design was a major consideration.
4. Review of this project and its design principles laid the foundation for subsequent, larger projects.
5. My first project that was made at the request of another party.
6. My first project where I was designing for an end user significantly different than myself.


Description:
When my professor and academic advisor approached me to make a demo for a potential educational game that would be intereacted by young children through augemented reality, I was excited an intimidated.
I had decided to use RayLib for the project, since it was easy to use and I already had some experience. The demo was much larger and arrived much sooner than anticipated.
The player controls a gray robot, which starts in the middle. There are walls and coins randomly placed in the area. 
The player chooses moves: up, down, left, and right, and puts them on a stack to be executed in order by the robot. 
When the player presses the red button, the robot begins to move and pops commands off the stack as it progresses.
The player tries to collect as many coins as possible using only 12 moves.

The idea was that a more completed version could teach programming concepts by giving the player access to series of commands and placing them in a procedural way as to accomplish a goal.
It was envisioned that players would be able to group a sequence of commands together and name it as a single command. The same concept of functions in programming languages.
